 PLIMACS        by Frank Clarke, rexxhead@yahoo.com

 The REXX routines found here fall into several broad categories.
 They are either (a) EXECs or (b) MACROs designed either (c) to
 operate on PL/I code or (d) to operate on PL/I compiler listings.

 Some of these routines need code that is NOT bundled with the
 remainder of FILE1040.  All such external code blocks will be found
 on FILE433.  An example of that is TBLGEN.  If a routine complains
 about not having essential code, it's on FILE433.

 In addition, some routines have lately been made 'RUNDATA-aware';
 that is: constants in a routine that may differ site-to-site (and
 which need to be set at each such site) are now obtained from the
 RUNDATA table via the use of REXX RUNDATA (q.v.).  So, instead of
 laboriously customizing such RUNDATA-aware routines, an installer
 places the necessary values on their local RUNDATA table and those
 routines are permanently customized.  RUNDATA can be found on CBT
 FILE1056.

 As with FILE433, most of this is "REXXSKEL-based", referring to
 member REXXSKEL on FILE433 that forms the backbone of the bulk of my
 code.  All REXXSKEL-based code operates similarly: if the first token
 passed as a parm is a question mark, the routine displays its
 HELP-text (if such exists) and exits.  Parsing of parameters is
 handled via a suite of embedded routines, KEYWD, SWITCH, and KEYPHRS
 prime among them.  Arguments passed are divided by a double open
 parentheses ("((") into 'parms' before and 'opts' after.  These may
 be thought of as 'What shall we do?' and 'How shall we do it?' As a
 general rule, naive users will not need to specify 'opts'.  Tracing
 is controlled by a parameter in 'opts' such as:
      ===> tso zork  (( trace ?r

 Many routines exhibit a warning block at the top:
   |**-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-**|
   |                                                                 |
   |          WARNING: EMBEDDED COMPONENTS.                          |
   |                      See text following TOOLKIT_INIT            |
   |                                                                 |
   |**-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-***-**|
 This identifies routines that carry (typically) ISPF assets such as
 panels or skeletons that are used in the process.  COMPILE is a
 complex example of this.  During installation, these elements
 (especially skeletons) should be examined for necessary
 pre-deployment changes.

 Renumbering this code is not recommended.  HELP text typically
 occupies all 80 columns, and any embedded panels or skeletons may
 extend into the number field such that they will be ruined by
 renumbering.

 Most of the EXECs will carry an 'Impact Analysis' section near the
 top that identifies external code elements used.  If the IA section
 identifies code not in FILE1040, it's in FILE433.  RUNDATA is in
 FILE1056.
